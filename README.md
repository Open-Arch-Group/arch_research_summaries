## Research Summaries

Reading and understanding architecture research (both classical and contemporary) can be a daunting task. It can also be difficult to stay up-to-date with the latest in architecture research. The goal of this repository is to help with both of these challenges by:

1. Providing a clear and concise summary of research papers
2. Providing a survey of architecture research broken down by area (e.g., branch prediction)
3. Highlighting influential and foundational research that revolutionized research areas

## Teaching Material

There are many resources online to learn about computer architecture. However, most of these resources have limited depth, leaving the burden on the reader to find another resource to learn more advanced topics. The goal of the teaching material in this repository is to provide users with readers with both breadth and depth of architecture educational material.
